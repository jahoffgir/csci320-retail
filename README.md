Phase 1
- [ ] Report outlining:
    * your progress,
    * a description of your design,
    * any choices made in the design process,
    * issues faced in the design process and solutions to the issues,
    * explanation of your ER diagram and reduction to tables,
    * a description of the data you plan to use
- [ ] ER diagram: separate  le is  ne but must be a PDF
- [ ] A listing of sample data used in your database
- [ ] A  storyboard  of  your   nal  UI.  Basically  a  sample  of  what  the  UI  will  look  like.  Asimple storyboard of actions that a user can preform is sufficient. Example each of thepurpose of the UI shown in each of the mockups. This does not have to be fancy atthis point. Hand drawn mockups are fine.
