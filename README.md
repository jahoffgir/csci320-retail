Principles of Data Management Project - Retail

Phase 1
- [ ] Report outlining:
    * your progress,
    * a description of your design,
    * any choices made in the design process,
    * issues faced in the design process and solutions to the issues,
    * explanation of your ER diagram and reduction to tables,
    * a description of the data you plan to use
- [ ] ER diagram: separate file is fine but must be a PDF
- [ ] A listing of sample data used in your database
- [ ] A  storyboard  of  your final  UI.  Basically  a  sample  of  what  the  UI  will  look  like.  A simple storyboard of actions that a user can preform is sufficient. Example each of the purpose of the UI shown in each of the mockups. This does not have to be fancy at this point. Hand drawn mockups are fine.
